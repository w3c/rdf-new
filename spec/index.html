    <h2>Introduction</h2>

    <p>This document is informative in nature.  Its
      purpose is to provide a summary of differences between RDF versions 1.1
      and 1.2 and to introduce new additions in a very brief manner.</p>

    <p>Readers new to RDF should start with the [[[RDF12-PRIMER]]] [[RDF12-PRIMER]]
      and then move on to the specifications in which they are
      most interested.  This document is meant to serve as a guide for those
      already familiar with RDF 1.1 who wish to understand changes in version
      1.2.</p>

    <p>Normative specifications of RDF can be found in the
      following documents: </p>
    <ul>
      <li>A document describing the basic concepts underlying RDF, as
        well as abstract syntax ([[[RDF12-CONCEPTS]]]) [[RDF12-CONCEPTS]]</li>
      <li>A document describing the formal model-theoretic semantics
        of RDF ([[[RDF12-SEMANTICS]]]) [[RDF12-SEMANTICS]]</li>
      <li>Specifications of concrete syntaxes for RDF, such as Turtle
        [[RDF12-TURTLE]], TriG [[RDF12-TRIG]], N-Triples [[RDF12-N-TRIPLES]],
        N-Quads [[RDF12-N-QUADS]] and JSON-LD [[JSON-LD11]].
        RDFa [[RDFA-PRIMER]] is also a concrete syntax for RDF, but it was not defined
        by the RDF Working Group.
        The 2004 RDF/XML syntax was updated to be in line with the RDF 1.2
        specifications [[RDF12-XML]]. </li>
      <li>A document describing RDF Schema [[RDF12-SCHEMA]], which
        provides a data-modeling vocabulary for RDF data. </li>
    </ul>

    <p>The following prefixes are used in this document:</p>

    <table class="simple">
      <caption>Prefixes and IRIs</caption>
      <tr><th>Namespace prefix</th><th>Namespace IRI</th><th>RDF vocabulary</th></tr>
      <tr>
        <td>rdf</td>
        <td><a href="http://www.w3.org/1999/02/22-rdf-syntax-ns#"><code>http://www.w3.org/1999/02/22-rdf-syntax-ns#</code></a></td>
        <td>The RDF built-in vocabulary [[RDF12-SCHEMA]]</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td>xsd</td>
        <td><a href="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#"><code>http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#</code></a></td>

<h3>Identifiers</h3>

<p>Identifiers in RDF 1.1 are now IRIs.  The following table
summarizes specific differences.</p>

<table class="simple">
  <caption>Identifiers in RDF 1.0 and 1.1.</caption>
  <tr>
        <th></th>
  <th>RDF 1.0</th>

  <td>Additional characters</td>
  <td>
  &quot;&lt;&quot;, &quot;&gt;&quot;,
  &quot;{&quot;, &quot;}&quot;, &quot;|&quot;, &quot;\&quot;, &quot;^&quot;,
  &quot;`&quot;, ‘&quot;’ (double quote), and &quot; &quot; (space)
  </td>
  <td>None; percent-encoding must be used as described in
        section 2.1 of [[RFC3986]]. </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
  <td>Fragment identifiers</td>
  <td>Fragment identifiers interpreted in accordance with RDF/XML representation.
  </td>
  <td>Full IRIs, including possible fragment identifiers, denote a resource.
  </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
  <td>Blank nodes</td>
  <td>
  RDF 1.0 makes no reference to any internal structure of blank nodes. Given two
  blank nodes, it is possible to determine whether or not they are the same.
  </td>
  <td>
  Blank node identifiers are local identifiers that are used in
  some concrete RDF syntaxes or RDF store implementations. They are
  always locally scoped to the file or RDF store, and are not
  persistent or portable identifiers for blank nodes. See the section
  in Concepts and Abstract Syntax regarding Skolemization if blank
  nodes must be shared between implementations.

<!--section id="literals">

<h3>Literals</h3>

<p>The following table summarizes differences in the handling of literals.</p>

<table class="simple">
  <caption>Literals in RDF 1.0 and 1.1.</caption>
  <tr>
        <th></th>
  <th>RDF 1.0</th>
  <th>RDF 1.1</th>
  </tr>
  <tr>
  <td>Language tags</td>
  <td>Literals with a language tag did not have a datatype URI.</td>
  <td>Literals with language tags now have the datatype IRI
        <code>rdf:langString</code>. </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
  <td rowspan="2">Simple literals</td>
  <td>Simple literals could appear directly, e.g. "a literal".</td>
  <td>All literals have datatypes; serializations or other
        implementations might choose to support syntax for simple literals,
        but only as synonyms for <code>xsd:string</code> literals.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
  <td>Control codes in the #x0-#x1F range were permitted.</td>
  <td>The <code>xsd:string</code> datatype does not permit the
        #x0 character, and implementations might not permit control codes in
        the #x1-#x1F range.  A literal with type <code>xsd:string</code>
        containing the #x0 character is ill-typed. </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
  <td>Language tags</td>
  <td>Permitted language tags that adhered to the generic
        tag/subtag syntax of language tags, but were not well-formed
        according to [[BCP47]]. </td>
  <td>Language tags must be well-formed according to [[BCP47]].</td>
  </tr>
</table>

<p>Planned updates to DOM version 4 [[DOM4]] are not complete as of
this writing.  The Working  Group decided to
follow the changes to the DOM in order to support the
new datatype <code>rdf:HTML</code>.
The unfinished status of DOM version 4 is why both
<code>rdf:HTML</code> and <code>rdf:XMLLiteral</code> are
non-normative in RDF 1.1 Concepts.  RDF 1.1 Concepts and Abstract
Syntax clarifies functionality deemed to be
useful for those including fragments of XML and HTML content in RDF
serialization formats.</p>

</section -->

<!--section id="datasets">

<h3>Datasets</h3>

<p>RDF 1.1 introduces the concept of RDF Datasets.  An RDF Dataset is a collection of RDF
Graphs.  SPARQL 1.2 [[SPARQL12-CONCEPTS]] also defines the concept of an RDF Dataset, but
the definition in RDF 1.1 differs slightly in that RDF 1.1 allows RDF Graphs to be
identified using either an IRI or a blank node. More information is available in
RDF 1.1 Concepts and Abstract Syntax.</p>

<p>The semantics of RDF Datasets
are minimally specified as of RDF
1.1. The Working Group published a
draft Note discussing issues related
to semantics of datasets [[RDF11-DATASETS]].</p>

<p>RDF Graphs may be named using an IRI or a blank node.  RDF Graphs that are so named are
called named graphs.</p>

<p>RDF 1.1 includes three new serialization formats capable of
representing multiple graphs.</p>

</section -->

<!--section id="datatypes">

<h3>Datatypes</h3>

<p>A table of RDF-compatible XSD datatypes has been added to RDF 1.1 Concepts and
Abstract Syntax.  Any XSD datatypes not represented in this table are incompatible
with RDF.  The following XSD 1.1 datatypes were added to the list of
RDF-compatible datatypes:</p>

<ul>
  <li><code>xsd:duration</code></li>
  <li><code>xsd:dayTimeDuration</code></li>
  <li><code>xsd:yearMonthDuration</code></li>
  <li><code>xsd:dateTimeStamp</code></li>
</ul>

<p>Support for <code>rdf:XMLLiteral</code> support is now
optional.  Technically, support for
any individual datatype is optional and therefore may not be present in a given
implementation.  RDF-conformant specifications may require specific
datatype maps.</p>

<section id="section-serializations">

<h2>New Serialization Formats</h2>

<p>RDF 1.1 introduces a number of new serialization formats. RDF 1.1 Concepts and
Abstract Syntax makes it clear that RDF/XML is no longer the only recommended serialization
format; RDF itself should be considered to be the data model (the
abstract syntax), not any particular serialization.</p>

<section id="section-semantics">

<h2>Semantics</h2>

<p>Most of the changes between RDF and RDF 1.1 do not have any effect on
implementations of entailment.</p>

<p>Datatype entailment formally refers to a set of 'recognized' datatypes,
replacing datatype maps in RDF 1.0 Semantics, but this does not have any
effect on implementation.</p>

<p>Datatype entailment formally refers to a set of 'recognized' datatype IRIs.
The RDF 1.0 Semantics used the concept of a datatype map: in the new semantic
description, this is the mapping from recognized IRIs to the datatypes they
identify. This change does not have any effect on implementation or semantic
entailments.</p>

<p>RDF entailment has two required datatypes <code>xsd:string</code>
and <code>rdf:langString</code>
which must be recognized, but this doesn't appreciably add to RDF
entailment as these two datatypes replace plain literals.</p>

<p>One change that does affect entailment is that graphs containing invalid
literals (e.g., <code>"a"^^xsd:integer</code>) are immediately inconsistent for
recognized datatypes, even in sub-RDFS entailment regimes.</p>

<p>RDF 1.1 includes RDF Datasets. However, the semantics of RDF Datasets in
RDF 1.1 is minimal and entailment per se is only defined on RDF graphs so
there are no changes here.</p>
